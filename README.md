# Robotic-Arm
Robotic Arm is a robot arm simulation based on ATmega328P Microcontroller.
## Constraints
During the pandemic, lack of available resources and lockdown limited our Robotic Arm to a mere simulation. 
# Requirements
In order to run the hardware simulation of Robotic Arm, you will need to install **Proteus 8** on your PC. If you wish to recompile Embedded C code, you would need to install Microchip Studio by Atmel.
